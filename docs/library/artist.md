# Artist

An Artist is a class that owns a `Model` and a `Canvas`, and provides a convenient interface for drawing 
entities associated with the model. That is, rather than manually drawing lines and surfaces
through the `Canvas`, an artist can be used to draw higher-level entities like frames and shells.
